# Banking Management Application

It was developed in my 4th semester. A Bank Management 
System (BMS) is a software application designed to manage 
and streamline the operations of a bank or financial 
institution. It facilitates efficient handling of banking services, 
transactions, and customer data, providing a secure, scalable, 
and user-friendly solution for both customers and bank 
employees.
